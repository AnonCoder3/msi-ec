In addition to these platform device attributes the driver registers itself in the Linux power_supply subsystem (Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-power) and is available to userspace under:

- `/sys/class/power_supply/<supply_name>/charge_control_start_threshold`

  - Access: Read, Write
  - Valid values: 0 - 100 (percent)

This driver might not work on other laptops produced by MSI. Also, and until future enhancements, no DMI data are used to identify your compatibility.
